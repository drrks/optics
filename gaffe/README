This is GAFFE a toolbox for the Generalised Adaptive Fast Fourier
Evolution (GAFFE) of N-dimensional, potentially nonlinear partial
differential equations.  It is a highly generalised implementation of
a 3rd order accurate split step technique for modeling, chiefly, wave
equations under the slowly varying envelope approximation. Unlike many
naieve approaches this adapts both the sampling grid and the step size
to trade-off precision and speed.  In addition it is capable of
modeling problems with any number of dimensions.
